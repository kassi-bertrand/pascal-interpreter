# Let's build a simple interpreter

I started following the "[Let's build an interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/)" series from Ruslan Spivak.

# Why?

1. To learn more about interpreters, compilers, and programming languages in general.

2. To get out of my comfort zone. I have never tried to build an interpreter before, so I think it'll help me grow, as a Computer Science student.

3. Acquire new skills, or find new ways to apply the ones I already have :)

# Objectives

By the end of this series, my goal is to build a:

1. *Pascal interpreter*: A program that reads PASCAL code, understands it, and executes it

2. *Source-level debugger*: A tool to control program execution, set break points in the code, etc.
