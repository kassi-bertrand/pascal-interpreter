_NOTE:_ I am currently following the [Let's Build A Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) tutorial 
from Ruslan Spivak. This challenge is the hands-on activity in PART 1, of the walkthrough.

`Programming language used`: Python

`Prompt`

Download and modify the code from _`calc1.py`_ so it that:

1. It handles multiple-digit integers in the input, for example: "12+3"

2. It skips whitespace characters so that your calculator can handle
inputs whith whitespace characters, for instance: "12 + 3"

3. It evaluates substractions ('-'), instead of additions ('+').

`Useful Resources`:

- [calc1.py](https://github.com/rspivak/lsbasi/blob/master/part1/calc1.py)
